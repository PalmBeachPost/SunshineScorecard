                        <p>The scoring system for the Florida Society News Editors was revised for the 2018 legislative session. It assigns points for a list of critical government openness bills. Legislators get three points for a floor vote; three points for a committee vote; seven points for co-sponsoring a bill; and 10 points for sponsoring a bill that's on the list. Votes against openness lose points; votes for openness gain points. Legislators can get a bonus point for communicating with the Florida First Amendment Foundation about a bill. The list of bills is determined by the Florida First Amendment Foundation.</p>
                        <p>A completely neutral score would result in zero points, drawing a C. Each legislator's grading system is based upon their opportunity to cast votes in floor and committee votes; a legislator who could vote in four of them, at three points each, would be graded on a scale of -12 to +12 points, then; a legislator who could vote in six of them would be graded on a scale of -18 to +18 points. Letter grades are then assigned according to the point scale. Sponsorships, co-sponsorships and communication with the Florida First Amendment Foundation might push legislators off the scale, resulting in A++ and F-- grades.</p>
                        <p>Some committees voted repeatedly on multiple versions of the bills, resulting in multiple votes in our tally. Some legislators considered a single bill in several committees, resulting in more recorded votes. Each time a legislator voted, that vote -- against or for government openness -- is counted.</p>
                        <p>The methodology is significantly changed from that of the <a href="http://apps.mypalmbeachpost.com/SunshineScorecard17" target="_blank">2017 SunshineScorecard</a>, so the grades are not directly comparable. Methodology for that version is included in that report. Also, legislative sessions themselves naturally include different bills, often of significantly differing character than in previous years. This can also cause scores to vary.</p>
