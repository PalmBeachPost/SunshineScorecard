                        <p>The scoring system for the Florida Society of News Editors (FSNE) assigns points for a list of critical government openness bills. Legislators get three points for a floor vote or a committee vote, seven points for co-sponsoring a bill, and 10 points for sponsoring a bill that's on the list. Votes against openness lose points; votes for openness gain points. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/113g80BDM3sM0nnSbSmDGlD_8-BLm0xA0llrIM5MiHPc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">list of bills</a> is determined by the Florida First Amendment Foundation in cooperation with FSNE.</p>

                        <p>A completely neutral score would result in zero points, drawing a C. Each legislator's grading system is based upon their opportunity to cast votes in floor and committee votes; a legislator who could vote in four of them, at three points each, would be graded on a scale of -12 to +12 points; a legislator who could vote in six of them would be graded on a scale of -18 to +18 points. Letter grades are then assigned according to the point scale from F- to A+. Sponsorships (10 points) and co-sponsorships (seven points) are calculated as extra credit and can push legislators off the scale. Some legislators also received five points for helping to amend bills which would have otherwise had a negative impact on open records laws.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some committees voted repeatedly on multiple versions of the bills, resulting in multiple votes in our tally. Some legislators considered a single bill in several committees, resulting in more recorded votes. Each time a legislator voted, that vote – against or for government openness – is counted.</p>

                        <p>The methodology is changed slightly  from that of the <a href="https://content.orlandosentinel.com/SunshineScorecard18/" target="_blank">2018 Sunshine Scorecard</a>, as legislators no longer receive points for communicating with the First Amendment Foundation.</p>

                        <p>Legislative sessions themselves naturally include different bills, often of significantly differing character than in previous years. This can also cause scores to vary.</p>
