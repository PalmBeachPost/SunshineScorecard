                        <p>The scoring system for the Florida Society of News Editors was revised for the 2018 legislative session. It assigns points for a list of critical government openness bills. New this year: Legislators get three points for a floor vote. Legislators also get three points for a committee vote; seven points for co-sponsoring a bill; and 10 points for sponsoring a bill that's on the list. Votes against openness lose points; votes for openness gain points. Legislators can get a bonus point for communicating with the Florida First Amendment Foundation about a bill. The list of bills is determined by the Florida First Amendment Foundation. The 2018 legislative session reviewed twice as many bills as the 2017 session.</p>

                        <p>A completely neutral score would result in zero points, drawing a C. Each legislator's grading system is based upon their opportunity to cast votes in floor and committee votes; a legislator who could vote in four of them, at three points each, would be graded on a scale of -12 to +12 points, then; a legislator who could vote in six of them would be graded on a scale of -18 to +18 points. Letter grades are then assigned according to the point scale from F- to A+. Sponsorships (10 points), co-sponsorships (seven points) and communication with the Florida's First Amendment Foundation (one point) are calculated as extra credit and can push legislators off the scale.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some committees voted repeatedly on multiple versions of the bills, resulting in multiple votes in our tally. Some legislators considered a single bill in several committees, resulting in more recorded votes. Each time a legislator voted, that vote – against or for government openness – is counted.</p>

                        <p>The methodology is significantly changed from that of the <a href="http://apps.mypalmbeachpost.com/SunshineScorecard17" target="_blank">2017 SunshineScorecard</a>, so the grades are not directly comparable. Methodology for that version is included in that report. 

                        <p>Legislative sessions themselves naturally include different bills, often of significantly differing character than in previous years. This can also cause scores to vary.</p>
